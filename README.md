In this SQL practice, I learned how to apply advanced SQL techniques such as JOINs, subqueries, GROUP BY, and HAVING clauses. 
I used these skills to analyze customer spending, find patterns in the order data, and filter based on aggregate values.
The most challenging part was understanding when to use WHERE vs HAVING and how to structure subqueries properly to filter data based on calculated values.
